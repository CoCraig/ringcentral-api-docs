If you have previously submitted an App Gallery profile, you can create a revision to submit for review. When making a revision to existing profile, you do not need to worry about overwriting your existing profile, as we review all changes prior to making them public.

## Click "Start a revision"

To create a revision, find the app whose profile you would like to edit. Click the "Promote" menu option.

For the profile you wish to update, hover over the "more" menu icon and click "start a revision."

## Make your changes

Your current profile will be shown to you by default. Proceed to make any changes you feel are necessary.

## Submit your revision for review

When you are done, click the button "Submit for approval." A dialog will appear asking when you would like to have your changes published. You will also be prompted to provide a summary of your changes. We recommend providing as much detail as you can to expedite the processing of your revision.
