# Sending Pager Messages

Pager messages are RingCentral specific types of text messages which can be sent between extensions of one account. Unlike SMS, pager messages can be sent to multiple recipients, so the API allows several extension numbers in the `to` field. Another difference from SMS is that the pager message that is sent to the department extension is automatically forwarded to all department members. This allows setting up dedicated mailing lists within the organization. The endpoint `company-pager` is designed to handle pager messages. The example below demonstrates sending new pager messages via the API.

=== "Request"
	```http
	POST /restapi/v1.0/account/~/extension/~/company-pager HTTP/1.1
	Content-Type: application/json
	Content-Length: ACTUAL_CONTENT_LENGTH_HERE

	{
	  "to": [{"extensionNumber": "102"}, 
		 {"extensionNumber": "103"}],

	  "from": {"extensionNumber": "101"},
	  "text": "Hello!"
	}
	```

=== "Response"
	```http
	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	Content-Type: application/json

	{
	  "uri":".../account/1346632010/extension/1346632010/message-store/320272670010",
	  "id":320272670010,
	  "to":[
	    { "extensionNumber":"101" },
	    { "extensionNumber":"102" },
	    { "extensionNumber":"103" }
	  ],
	  "from":{
	    "extensionNumber":"101"
	  },
	  "type":"Pager",

	  "attachments":[

	      "uri":"http:.../restapi/v1.0/account/1346632010/extension/1346632010/message-store/320272670010/content/1",
	      "contentType":"text/plain"
	    }
	  ],
	  "direction":"Outbound",

	}
	```

## Sending Pager Messages on Behalf of a Call Queue

Sending pager messages on behalf of a Department is NOT allowed. In the case of such an attempt, the authenticated department manager is notified that sending pages is not allowed for the `Department` extension type.

## Sending Pager Messages to Disabled and Frozen Exensions

Sending pager messages to Disabled and Frozen extension types is not allowed. When a pager message is sent to a Disabled/Frozen extension or to the list of extensions containing at least one Disabled/Frozen extension, the server immediately responds with the `400 Bad Request` error code and the explanatory message. But if the page is sent to a Department extension list containing any Disabled/Frozen extensions, the error is not returned, and this pager message is received only by active extensions of the Department.

## Pager Messaging Threads

The API supports pager messaging threads for User extensions, including Department extensions. Those internal message conversations are not accessible for reading or writing by users which were removed from the explicit or implicit list of recipients in this conversation. For example, a user extension included in a Department extension is able to participate in the Department conversation, sending and receiving messages. Once this particular user is removed from the department, he/she is not able to reply to previous messages, nor send or receive new messages. It means that, when somebody posts a reply to a particular conversation (by indicating `replyOn` in API requests), the server checks if the user belongs to the actual list of recipients (implicitly, through Department membership, or explicitly). If the user does not belong to the recipient list, the server returns the 403 Forbidden error code with the appropriate logical code.
