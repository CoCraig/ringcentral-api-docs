# SMS Java Quick Start

Welcome to the RingCentral Platform. RingCentral is the leading unified communications platform. From one system developers can integrate with, or build products around all the ways people communicate today: SMS, voice, fax, chat and meetings.

In this Quick Start, we are going to help you send your first SMS on the platform in just a few minutes. Let's get started.

!!! note "Also check out our SMS Best Practices Guide"
    After you finish this quick start, be sure to read our [SMS Best Practices Guide](../../sms/best-practices/).

## Create App and Get Credentials

The first thing we need to do is create an app in the RingCentral Developer Portal. This can be done quickly by clicking the "Create SMS App" button below. Just click the button, enter a name and description if you choose, and click the "Create" button. If you do not yet have a RingCentral account, you will be prompted to create one.

<a class="btn-link btn-collapse" data-toggle="collapse" href="#create-app-instructions" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="create-app-instructions">Show detailed instructions</a>

<div class="collapse" id="create-app-instructions">
<ol>
<li><a href="https://developer.ringcentral.com/login.html#/">Login or create an account</a> if you have not done so already.</li>
<li>Go to Console/Apps and click 'Create App' button.</li>
<li>Select "API App for RingCentral Office" under "What type of app are you creating?"</li>
<li>Select "Other Non-UI" under "Where will you be calling the API from?"
<li>Select "Only members of my organization/company" under "Who will be authorized to access your app?"
<li>On the second page of the create app wizard, enter your app's name and description. Then select the following permissions:
  <ul>
    <li>SMS</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
<li>We are using Password Flow authentication, so leave "OAuth Redirect URI" blank.</li>
</ol>
</div>

When you are done, you will be taken to the app's dashboard. Make note of the Client ID and Client Secret. We will be using those momentarily.

## Send an SMS

### Create a Java project (using Eclipse IDE)

* Create a new Java project
* Select the Gradle Project wizard
* Enter project name "Send_SMS"
* Open the <tt>build.gradle</tt> file and add the RingCentral Java SDK to the project as shown below:

```json hl_lines="3",linenums="1"
dependencies {
    // ...
    compile 'com.ringcentral:ringcentral:1.0.0-beta10'
}
```

* Right-click the project in the Package Explorer and choose "Refresh Gradle Project" under the "Gradle" sub-menu

### Create a new Java Class

Select "File -> New -> Class" to create a new Java class named "Send_SMS"

```java
package Send_SMS;

public class Send_SMS {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

	}
}
```

### Edit the file "Send_SMS.java".

Be sure to edit the variables in ALL CAPS with your app and user credentials. Be sure to also set the recipient's phone number.

```java
package Send_SMS;

import java.io.IOException;

import com.ringcentral.*;
import com.ringcentral.definitions.*;


public class Send_SMS {
    static String RECIPIENT_NUMBER = "<ENTER PHONE NUMBER>";

    static String RINGCENTRAL_CLIENTID = "<ENTER CLIENT ID>";
    static String RINGCENTRAL_CLIENTSECRET = "<ENTER CLIENT SECRET>";
    static String RINGCENTRAL_SERVER = "https://platform.devtest.ringcentral.com";

    static String RINGCENTRAL_USERNAME = "<YOUR ACCOUNT PHONE NUMBER>";
    static String RINGCENTRAL_PASSWORD = "<YOUR ACCOUNT PASSWORD>";
    static String RINGCENTRAL_EXTENSION = "<YOUR EXTENSION, PROBABLY '101'>";

    static RestClient restClient;
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var obj = new Send_SMS();
        try {
          restClient = new RestClient(RINGCENTRAL_CLIENTID, RINGCENTRAL_CLIENTSECRET, RINGCENTRAL_SERVER);
          restClient.authorize(RINGCENTRAL_USERNAME, RINGCENTRAL_EXTENSION, RINGCENTRAL_PASSWORD);
          obj.send_sms()();
        } catch (RestException | IOException e) {
          e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
    public static void send_sms() throws RestException, IOException {
        CreateSMSMessage postParameters = new CreateSMSMessage();
        postParameters.from = new MessageStoreCallerInfoRequest().phoneNumber(RINGCENTRAL_USERNAME);
        postParameters.to = new MessageStoreCallerInfoRequest[]{new MessageStoreCallerInfoRequest().phoneNumber(RECIPIENT_NUMBER)};
        postParameters.text = "Hello World from Java";

        var response = restClient.restapi().account().extension().sms().post(postParameters);
        System.out.println("SMS sent. Message status: " + response.messageStatus);
    }
}
```

### Run Your App

You are almost done. Now run your app from Eclipse.
